# myvimrc
This is my vimrc file. Its full of little bits and pieces that I've found
serve my workflow well. It points to Gruvbox theme, which you'll need to
install to get the theme.

## Install
Download/clone this repo and copy .vimrc to your home directory (~/.vimrc) 
and you should be good to go.
